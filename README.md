## 📒 Description
- This repository consists of scripts related to data analysis of the study *Handgrip strength predicts physical and psychological domains of quality of life, but not social and environmental domains*. This stydy investiganted the association between handgrip strength with quality of life in different domains of quality of life.

## 📃 Abstract of the study

- **Objective**: This study investigated the association between handgrip strength with quality of life in different domains of quality of life. 

- **Methods**: This is a cross-sectional study. Participants underwent a semi-structured interview to record age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, family income. Also, individuals performed the handgrip strength test. 

- **Results**: Two hundred individuals were evaluated. Overall, the sample comprised individuals of both sexes (79% female) aged 52±17 years. High strength group showed high values of quality of life in physical (71.5 vs. 64.1 a.u.; 95%CI 2.0 to 12.6; P=0.0066) and psychological domain in comparison with low strength group (72.0 vs. 67.4 a.u.; 95%CI -0.1 to 9.3; P=0.0214). No between-group differences were observed for quality of life in the social and environmental domains (both P>0.05). Significant positive associations were found between handgrip strength and quality of life in physical and psychological domain (R=0.27, P<0.0001 and R=0.17, P=0.0117, respectively). No significant association between handgrip strength and quality of life in social and environment was observed. Adjusted linear regression model showed a positive association between handgrip strength and quality of life in physical (β=0.74; 95%CI 0.37 to 1.11; P<0.001), and psychological (β=0.38; 95%CI 0.06 to 0.71; P=0.022) domain. In contrast, handgrip strength did not show to be an independent predictor of quality of life in social and environment domains (both P>0.05). 

- **Conclusion**: These findings reveal handgrip strength is a significant and independent predictor of quality of life in physical and psychological domains, but not in social and environmental domains.

- **Inclusion criteria** were: 
        
        - (i) individuals aged over 17 years. 

- **Exclusion criteria** were: 

        - (i) cognitive deficit that precluded the patient from reading and signing the informed consent form;
        
        - (ii) people with disabilities; 
        
        - (iii) cancer in the past 5 years; 
        
        - (iv) inability to perform the physical tests; 
        
        - (v) prior diagnosis of muscle degenerative disease (e.g., myopathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). 

Participants underwent a semi-structured interview to record sociodemographic characteristic (i.e., age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, family income). Also, individuals performed the handgrip strength test in dominant arm
